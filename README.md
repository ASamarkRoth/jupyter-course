# Interactive Data Exploration for Scientists

## Syllabus


## Program

All lectures are available on this site in the [lectures](lectures) folder on this Github repository and are in Notebook format.

- Lecture 1. Introduction
  - Introduction and overview of Jupyter notebooks
  - Installation and package management
  - Documenting using Markdown: rich text, equations, images, tables.
  - Other languages (bash, R, ruby, ...)
  - Online resources and getting help
  
- Lecture 2. Plotting
  - Plotting in Notebooks: Matplotlib
  - Arranging plots, customizing
  - Making plots publication ready.
  - Exporting to vectorized file formats
  
- Lecture 3. Numerical methods
  - Numerical and scientific python (`numpy`, `scipy`)
  - Symbolic math (`sympy`)
  - Working with large datasets (`pandas`)
  - Calling C/C++/fortran routines

## Prerequisites

- No prior knowledge in Python is required, but familiarity with
programming concepts is helpful.
- A laptop running Unix, MacOS, or Windows.

## Course Evaluation

Each student will make a Notebook project with either

1. their own research, presenting data analysis and theory behind
   a manuscript or published paper. The Notebook should be written
   such that it could act as supporting information (SI) for a journal.
   
2. _or_ a Notebook presenting a text-book topic of choice and aimed at students.
   The notebook should include rich documentation, use interactive graphs, and
   numerical methods.

The Notebook is peer-reviewed by two other course participants and the final Notebook
will be presented to the class.
This means that each student will peer-review two Notebook and should check that,

- the notebook is properly docmented and easy to follow
- that all graphs are polished and publication ready
