## Program

Lectures are available as Notebooks on this site in the [lectures](lectures) folder.

- Lecture 1. Introduction
  - Introduction and overview of Jupyter notebooks
  - Installation and package management
  - Documenting using Markdown: rich text, equations, images, tables.
  - Other languages (bash, R, ruby, root...)
  - Online resources and getting help
  
- Lecture 2. Plotting
  - Plotting in Notebooks: Matplotlib
  - Arranging plots, customizing
  - Making plots publication ready.
  - Exporting to vectorized file formats
  
- Lecture 3. Numerical methods
  - Numerical and scientific python (`numpy`, `scipy`)
  - Symbolic math (`sympy`)
  - Working with large datasets (`pandas`)
  - Calling C/C++/fortran routines

## Prerequisites

- No prior knowledge in Python is required, but familiarity with
programming concepts is helpful.
- A laptop running Unix, MacOS, or Windows.

## Evaluation

The evaluation consists of three steps:

1. Each student will make a Notebook project with either

  - their own research, presenting data analysis and theory behind
    a manuscript or published paper. The Notebook should be written
    such that it can act as supporting information (SI) for a journal.
   
  - _or_ a Notebook presenting a text-book topic of choice and aimed at students.
    The notebook should include rich documentation, use interactive graphs, and
    numerical methods.

2. A peer-review process where each student review and comment on two other notebooks.

3. Notebook presentation to the class
