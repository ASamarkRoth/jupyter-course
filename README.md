## Course Evaluation

Each student will make a Notebook with either

1. their own research, presenting data analysis and theory behind
   a manuscript or published paper. The Notebook should be written
   such that it could act as supporting information (SI) for a journal.
   
2. or a Notebook presenting a text-book topic of choice and aimed at students.
   The notebook should include rich documentation and preferably interactive
   graphs.

The Notebook is peer-reviewed by two other course participants and the final Notebook
will be presented to the class.
This means that each student will peer-review two Notebook and should check that,

- the notebook is properly docmented and easy to follow
- that all graphs are polished and publication ready
- ...
